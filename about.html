      <h3> About Charlene </h3>
      <p> After teaching for several years, and specifically teaching through the pandemic, I learned a lot about educational technology. While I loved being in the classroom, I also found that I could use that experience to make a difference from outside the classroom. That lead me to web development and <a href= "https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>, where I am currently a student.</p>

      <p> If you're looking to hire a new developer please reach out! I'm excited to work with other developers to build great software.</p>
